THIS WE NEED TO DO!!!!!

--LEXER STUFF--
General:
-Datastructure for DFA (KoffKoff, changed, might not be best atm)
-DFA needs to know accepting states. (Done, Maybe implement the whole accept structure later)
-Start building a wrapper (KoffKoff, Simple one is done)
-Implement good error messages (UNASSIGNED)
-Generate a haskell file with the lexer in it (UNASSIGNED)

Main.hs
-Instead of lexing it should generate a .hs file that lexes (UNASSIGNED)

IncLex.hs:
-Handle the case when two tokens can't be combined at all (UNASSIGNED)
-Needs to ba able to handle special characters (UNASSIGNED)
-Fix so that the lexer can lex single "else" or more general we need to be able
 to backtrack when we know a token can't be changed at a later stage (UNASSIGNED)
-The case of the '"' needs to be fixed (UNASSIGNED)
-Check for more bugs (UNASSIGNED)

Alex:
-Remove as much as possible (UNASSIGNED)
    -Remove not needed files (HUGO)
    -Remove not needed code (UNASSIGNED)

BuildDFA.hs
-Code cleanup (KoffKoff almost done)

--REPORT STUFF--
Chpater 2:
-Find more ref. and fill out the text (UNASSIGNED)
-Write about NFA & DFA from Aho2006, page 147- 151. (UNASSIGNED)

Chapter 3:
-Write an introduction part (KoffKoff)
-Start by make a list of what would be written about. (UNASSIGNED)
-Formal proof that our combination yields the correct token. (UNASSIGNED)
