THIS WE NEED TO DO!!!!!

--LEXER STUFF--
General:
-Datastructure for DFA (KoffKoff, changed, might not be best atm)
-DFA needs to know accepting states. (UNASSIGNED)
-Start building a wrapper (KoffKoff, started)
-How do we figure out if the lexer should build a token from an accepting state?
  recursive backwards stuffies seems legit...

IncLex.hs:
-Add so that Monoid Tokens handle lexing errors (KoffKoff)

Alex:
-Remove as much as possible (UNASSIGNED)
    -Remove not needed files (HUGO)
    -Remove not needed code (UNASSIGNED)

BuildDFA.hs
-Code cleanup (KoffKoff almost done)
-Implement good error messages (UNASSIGNED)

--REPORT STUFF--
Chpater 2:
-Find more ref. and fill out the text (UNASSIGNED)
-Write about NFA & DFA from Aho2006, page 147- 151. (UNASSIGNED)

Chapter 3:
Start by make a list of what would be written about. (UNASSIGNED)
    (Just a list, possible it will be changed over 9000 times before final)
