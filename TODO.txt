- Test some more with incremental updates
- Experiment tabulating the top-level function
- Cleanup/Productize (as an alex template)
- Report.

--LEXER STUFF--
General:
-Needs to ba able to handle special characters (UNASSIGNED)
-DFA needs to know accepting states. (Done, Maybe implement the priority structure?)
-Implement good error messages (UNASSIGNED)
-Implement test cases for our lexer (UNASSIGNED)
-Stupid bug when certain stuff are inserted which result in no tokens being generated for example "/**/"

HsBuilder.hs:
-Datastructure for DFA (KoffKoff, Better datatstructure for the inner map?)
-Better conversion from DFA then currently implemented (UNASSIGNED)
-How do we handle errors? example ("blablabla \n)
-Can we strip som of the transitions??

Main.hs
-Needed for anything but bug testing?

IncLex.hs:
-Check for more bugs (UNASSIGNED)
-Can we strip som of the transitions??

AbsSyn.hs
-Maybe move more data strucures here?

Alex:
-Remove as much as possible (UNASSIGNED)
    -Remove not needed files (HUGO)
    -Remove not needed code (UNASSIGNED)

BuildDFA.hs
-Is it done?

--REPORT STUFF--
Chpater 2:
-Find more ref. and fill out the text (UNASSIGNED)

Chapter 3:
-Write an introduction part (KoffKoff)
-Start by make a list of what would be written about. (UNASSIGNED)
