\chapter{Implementation}
Here we should talk about bnfc and
alex. What we use from the differnet programs. How this is usefull
is it becouse of lazynes or are the existing solutions good??

\section{Alex}
Alex is a tool for generating lexical analysers built in Haskell, given a description of the language
in form of regular expressions. The result will be Haskell 98 compatible and can easly be used with the
parser Happy, a parser generator for Haskell.

\section{Monoid}
In abstract algebra a monoid is a set, $S$, and a binary operation $\bullet$ which furfills the following
three properties:
\begin{description}
\item[Closure] $\forall a,b \in S: a \bullet b \in S$
\item[Associativity] $\forall a,b,c \in S: (a \bullet b) \bullet c = a \bullet (b \bullet c)$
\item[Identity element] $\exists e \in S: \forall a \in S: e \bullet a = a \bullet e = a$
\end{description}

\section{Fingertree}
What is this, how have this tool helped us in this project.
Some basics how it works and why it therefore fits our project.

\section{Sequences}
A sequence in Haskell is a form of sophisticated list. That is a list with better performance than the basic [] list notation. Where a list in Haskell has $\Theta(n)$ for finding, inserting or deleting elements, that is in a list there is only known current element and the rest of the list. Which will result in for example finding the last element of a list, the computer must look at every element until the empty list has been found as the rest of the list. Where in a sequence the last element can be obtained in $\Theta(1)$ time. Adding a element anywhere in the sequence can be done in worst case, $\Theta(log n)$ \cite{fingertree}. 

Since this project is about creating as real-time lexing tool, performance is very important. String in Haskell are just a list of characters, [Char], and therefor has $\Theta(n)$ in time cost. Lexing is working with strings in a high frequency and there for there is a idea of instead define a string as a sequence of characters instead of a list of character.
