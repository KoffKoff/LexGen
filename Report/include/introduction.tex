\chapter{Introduction}
*Usage of BNFC
*With help of regexp build a finit state machine that will lex a code string.
*Give finite states with corresponding Monoid data type.
*Flag for errors from the Lexer, give meningfull info to the user, and stop 
    the worklow after lexer, until new updated text.
*If no errors, handel layout
*Parse the Monoid data type tree, 
    AKA integrate the result with an existing parser.
*Smile and be happy!
