\section{Fingertree}
\subsection{Structure of Fingertrees}
A fingertree is a tree structure that is built to make access to the beginning
and end of the tree easy. This is achieved by having the leaves for the 1-4
first elements and 1-4 last elements in the root level of the tree, these are
called fingers. The rest of
the elements constitutes the spine which is another fingertree, with one
difference, instead of having the first 1-4 elements the second level will
instead have two 2-3 tree of depth 2 at the beginning and end of the tree. The
third level will have 2-3 trees of depth 3 and for level $n$ the 2-3 trees in
the beginning and end will have depth $n$.

%Code for the basic finger tree?

As can be seen in figure \cref{KÅÅD} there are three constructors for a
fingertree, there are the trivial cases for an empty tree and for a tree with
one element. The last constructor calls itself with $Node~a$ instead of just $a$.
This is what determines the depth of the 2-3 tree on each side of the spine. The
reasons for the first level of the tree having fingers of size 1-4 is because of
insertion and deletion which is covered in \cref{DEQUE BITCH}.

Accessing an element at place $d$ in the tree will take $\log(min(d,n-d))$. This
is because the closer to the end of the fingertree the element is the closer the
surface it is. This in turn gives the time complexity of accessing an element,
which in worst case is $O(\log n)$ and for the first and last element is $O(1)$

\subsection{Insertion and Deletion}
The fingers in a tree have two different states called dangerous and safe. The
safe states is when there are 2 to 3 elements in the finger and when the finger
is safe an insertion or deletion from the tree will not be anything more then an
insertion or deletion in that finger.

When a finger has 1 or 4 elements the finger is called dangerous. In this case
there might be implications down the spine. The first case is when there is an
insertion into a finger that has 4 elements, in this case there are 5 elements
that is assigned to the same level. If the insertion was done to the end of the
tree the last 2 elements will be the new finger which is then a safe finger. The
first 3 elements are used to create a new $Node3$ which is passed down the spine
as a single element to be inserted at the next level.

The other dangerous operation is when a deletion from a finger of size 1 is
done. In this case, if the deletion is made to the end of the tree, the last
element of the end finger in the spine is deleted and used as the finger for the
level where the the finger would have been empty. Since the element in the
finger below will either be a $Node2$ or a $Node3$ the new finger will be safe.

Since the dangerous states propagate actions down the spine insertion and
deletion will not have $O(1)$ time at the beginning and end of the tree. Since
each new level will take at most $O(1)$ time the insertion or deletion of an
element will in the worst case take $O(\log n)$ time. However since 3 of 4
operations are safe for insertion and deletion respectivly the expected time
consumption for an insertion or deletion will be $O(1)$ if the time for finding
the place for the insertion or deletion is disregarded.

\subsection{Concatenation of Fingertrees}
When 2 fingertrees are concatenated there are a number of different cases which
can occur. To begin with, when a concatenation of two trees is done a function
called $app3$ is called with the two trees and an empty list of ``between''
elements. As can be seen in \cref{app3 ref} there are 4 trivial cases, the first
two is when either tree is empty in which case the ``between'' elements is
added to the nonempty tree. The other two are when there is exactly one element
in one of the trees in which case that element is added to the other tree after
the ``between'' elements.

In the last case two trees of more then one elements
are concateneted. In this case, a new tree is created which has the first
finger set as the first finger from the first tree and the last finger set as
the last finger from the second tree. The spine will be created by calling
$app3$ recursivly with the spine from the first tree as the first tree, the last
finger of the first tree plus ``between'' elements plus the first finger of the
second tree as the new ``between'' elements and the spine from the second tree
as the second tree.

%Somthing about time complexity would be AWESOME!!
